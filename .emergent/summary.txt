The AI engineer successfully extended a cosmic portal landing page, focusing heavily on front-end interactivity and visual aesthetics. Key developments include implementing a dynamic payment and tipping system with an animated Pokeball and 游댩Ofrendas游댩 title, integrating Entradas M치gicas (simplified portal sections) with individual sub-pages, and creating a real-time visitor counter. Extensive effort was dedicated to intricate CSS for animations, positioning (especially for the Pokeball and Entradas M치gicas), and responsive design. The engineer also introduced full-page neon lights, mystical guardian eyes with complex effects, and a global audio context for seamless music-video coordination. Iterative user feedback on positioning, visual effects, and specific assets (like video thumbnails) drove continuous refinement. The latest work involves debugging a general page display issue reported by the user while coordinating audio and finishing visitor count implementation.

Z칛e Selenya requires a visually stunning, conversion-optimized cosmic portal landing page with a YouTube-style banner, Z칛e Selenya signature, pulsating profile photo, and an alien PNG sticker. Initial sections included three thematic portals with subscription forms. Key design principles emphasized  aesthetics, responsive design, modern typography, and a cinematic feel. Recent feature additions included a customized, image-based music player with real MP3 support and continuous playback; a personalized About section with custom text, symbols, and an integrated video introduction with advanced controls and custom thumbnails. The Z칛estelar.net link now navigates to an identical internal page. Further requirements evolved to remove all email fields, implement payment methods (Visa, PayPal) and a tip system (initially a pokeball that opens/closes), and ensure full responsiveness. The layout needed to constantly adapt for Entradas M치gicas (simplified portal sections) and 游댩Ofrendas游댩 (tips portal) with mystical guardian eyes and vertical neon lights, precise positioning, and synchronized spacing. Lastly, a real-time visitor counter (excluding owner) and automatic music-video pause/resume functionality across all pages were requested.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a global audio context to coordinate music playback with video playback. The goal was to automatically pause music when a video starts and resume it when the video ends or is paused, ensuring a seamless audio experience across all pages. The  was created and  was wrapped with .  and  were updated to utilize this context, and  was also integrated. The AI attempted to integrate  but encountered a lint error. Additionally, the AI had recently completed implementing a real-time visitor counter with backend integration and a clean-up of the page's lower sections. The last explicit user message was No puedo ver bien la pagina, indicating a general display issue on the live frontend. The AI's last action was to begin debugging this reported page display issue by taking a screenshot to diagnose the problem.
